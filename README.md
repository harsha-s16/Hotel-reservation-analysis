### Business Context:
Our client is a medium-sized hotel chain wanting to improve its booking and cancellation management system. Their dataset contains detailed reservation records, such as number of guests, booking dates, special requests, price per night, and whether the booking was eventually canceled.

### Why Do They Need a Data Scientist? 🚀

The hotel has recently seen a high amount of exhibit cancellations and this, in turn, has led to not only unpredictability in revenue streams but also to the inefficient room allocation. They need data driven insights to:

* Identify what's causing cancellations.
* Forecast the likely number of the bookings to be called off.
* Adapt pricing and policies in such a way as to decrease revenue loss.

How Can This Analysis Help? 🔍
Through EDA, we will:

✅ Clean and preprocess the dataset to make it ready to use.  
✅ Determine customer behavior patterns that lead to cancellations.  
✅ Answers key business questions to help business make smart choices.

By the end of this analysis, the hotel will have made sound decisions about customer policies, rates, and reservation management fewer financial shocks and more customer satisfaction.💡
